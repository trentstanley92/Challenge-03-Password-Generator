# Challenge-03-Password-Generator

## Description
Motivation behind this project was to create a password generator that would ask for user input of password length, then print out desired length randomly generated password. Solves the problem of creating a more complex password to avoid generic passwords. I learned how to use window prompt to ask for user input.

## Usage
When loaded into the random password generator, hit the generate button. You will be prompted to input a password length with characters between 8-128. Do so and you hit ok and it will generate a desired password.
